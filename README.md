## About Me

I'm a Computer Scientist and a true Linux lover. I've tried several distributions over the years, but currently, I live and breathe Arch (yes, I use Arch btw). I enjoy exploring new technologies, tackling challenges, and constantly learning. 

## Collaborations

I'm always looking for motivated developers to collaborate with on projects, whether it's app development, web projects, data science tools, cybersecurity, or anything else. I don't set limits and I'm open to new opportunities and challenges.
